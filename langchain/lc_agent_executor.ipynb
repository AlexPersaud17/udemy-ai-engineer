      "Summary: The programming language Python was conceived in the late 1980s, and its implementation was started in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to ABC capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Van Rossum is Python's principal author, and his continuing central role in deciding the direction of Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community, Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL). (However, Van Rossum stepped down as leader on July 12, 2018.). Python was named after the BBC TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus.\n",
      "Python 2.0 was released on October 16, 2000, with many major new features, such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collector (in addition to reference counting) and reference counting, for memory management and support for Unicode, along with a change to the development process itself, with a shift to a more transparent and community-backed process.\n",
      "Python 3.0, a major, backwards-incompatible release, was released on December 3, 2008 after a long period of testing. Many of its major features have also been backported to the backwards-compatible, though now-unsupported, Python 2.6 and 2.7. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.\n",

      "Page: Mojo (programming language)\n",
      "Summary: Mojo is a programming language in the Python family that is currently under development. It is available both in browsers via Jupyter notebooks, and locally on Linux and macOS. Mojo aims to combine the usability of a high-level programming language, specifically Python, with the performance of a system programming language such as C++, Rust, and Zig. As of February 2025, the Mojo compiler is closed source with an open source standard library. Modular, the company behind Mojo, has stated an intent to eventually open source the Mojo language, as it matures.\n",
      "Mojo builds on the Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) compiler software framework instead of directly on the lower level LLVM compiler framework, as do many languages such as Julia, Swift, Clang, and Rust. MLIR is a newer compiler framework that allows Mojo to exploit higher level compiler passes unavailable in LLVM alone, and allows Mojo to compile down and target more than only central processing units (CPUs), including producing code that can run on graphics  processing units (GPUs), Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and other accelerators. It can also often more effectively use certain types of CPU optimizations directly, like single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) with minor intervention by a developer, as occurs in many other languages. According to Jeremy Howard of fast.ai, Mojo can be seen as \"syntax sugar for MLIR\" and for that reason Mojo is well optimized for applications like artificial intelligence (AI).\n",

      "Summary: C (pronounced  – like the letter c) is a general-purpose programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems code (especially in kernels), device drivers, and protocol stacks, but its use in application software has been decreasing. C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems.\n",
      "A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system. During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages, with C compilers available for practically all modern computer architectures and operating systems. The book The C Programming Language, co-authored by the original language designer, served for many years as the de facto standard for the language. C has been standardized since 1989 by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and, subsequently, jointly by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).\n",
      "C is an imperative procedural language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code.\n",
      "Since 2000, C has consistently ranked among the top four languages in the TIOBE index, a measure of the popularity of programming languages.\n",

      "Summary: The C Programming Language (sometimes termed K&R, after its authors' initials) is a computer programming book written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, the latter of whom originally designed and implemented the C programming language, as well as co-designed the Unix operating system with which development of the language was closely intertwined.  The book was central to the development and popularization of C and is still widely read and used today.  Because the book was co-authored by the original language designer, and because the first edition of the book served for many years as the de facto standard for the language, the book was regarded by many to be the authoritative reference on C.\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mIn the field of data science, a data scientist should be familiar with several programming languages.
